/** \brief	Core functionality for creating the Graph-Laplacian for the random walks system
 *	\author	Athanasios Karamalis
 *  \date	10.06.2012
 *
 *	Implementation based on the work:
 *	Grady, L.: Random walks for image segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
 *	Machine Intelligence,28,11,1768-1783,2006
 *
 *	Performs most of the random walks algorithmic operations, except of assembling the Laplacian matrix.
 *	The Laplacian is problem specific and dimension specific.
 *
 *	Different solvers can be used for Ax=b including Conjugate Gradient for Eigen, the CG solver from ViennaCL
 *	that is available for both CPU and GPU

	Lu/Lm : relation of un-/marked nodes
	n : # marked nodes
	q : # unmarked nodes

	The final solution to the random walks problem is given as
	Lu X = -B^T M
	where X(qxl) are the potentials at the unmarked nodes with q is #unmarked nodes and l is #labels,
	M(nxl) are the marked unit potentials. For l=2 M(n,1) = 1 for n marked node with label 1.

	Instead of re-ordering the Laplace matrix (L) to get the blocks we can get them individually. For example, to get B^T we assemble it by taking
	the unmarked rows and the marked columns of L. For Lm we take the marked rows and marked cols from L and for Lu the unmarked rows and unmarked cols from L.

	Accessing entries in sparse matrices in Eigen using for example coeff costs log(rho*outer_size)!

	Therefore, we assemble the matrices through matrix operations with permutation matrix.
