    This is used to interpolate between all controlpoints.  The usual range from 0 to 1 that
    the interpolating variable can have is mapped to the interpolation between the current and
    the next controlpoint; thus, t = 0 yields the first controlpoint (or, to be exact, the second
    point since the first one is not included in the actual interpolation) and t = 1 yields the
    next to last point (since the last point is also not included in the interpolation).  The ending
    of the spline at t = 1.0 is just a standard, you can change it by specifiying a total variable
    to have more control about how fast the interpolation takes place (for example, if you want a very
    slow interpolation, you would set total to a bigger number like 5.0 which would make the interpolation
    5 times slower than normal when maintaining constant steps for the running variable t).
